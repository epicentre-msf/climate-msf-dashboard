# MSF Carbon Travel App

Welcome to the Carbon Travel Analysis Dashboard ! 

This is a data analysis dashboard to explore the *Carbon emissions* due to travel across the MSF movement.

## Project genesis

This project stems from the collaboration between the [Climate Smart MSF](https://msfintl.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/ClimateSmartMSF/SitePages/Main-Page.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=8t2nc5), a TIC (Transformational Investment capacity) project co-sponsored by MSF Canada and OCG, and the [Data Science Team](https://epicentre-msf.github.io/gallery/) at [Epicentre](https://epicentre.msf.org/). 

The initial goal of the project was to help minimise MSF flight travel emissions by providing a tool that could find the best location to host the many meetings and trainings that the movement organises. After discussion with carbon analysts, it was quickly realised that a dashboard providing key analysis and visualisation of MSF travel data would be greatly beneficial for carbon analyst's work, but also to raise awareness across MSF.

For any general enquiries regarding the project or **Climate Smart MSF** please contact [MaÃ«lle CHARRIER](mailto:Maelle.CHARRIER@geneva.msf.org). For technical enquiries regarding the app, please contact [Hugo SOUBRIER](mailto:hugo.soubrier@epicentre.msf.org) or [Paul CAMPBELL](mailto:paul.campbell@epicentre.msf.org). The code for the app is available on the [Epicentre GitHub](https://github.com/epicentre-msf/climate-msf-dashboard) where you can also [report an issue](https://github.com/epicentre-msf/climate-msf-dashboard/issues).

## Data source

The travel data are gathered from different sources depending on the travel agencies used by MSF entities. These data are cleaned and compiled before visualisation. These data can be exported from the App using the *Download data* button.

1. AMEX data are provided from 2019 to 2024 for OCG, OCA, OCB and other partner sections. 
2. WAGRAM data are provided from 2019 to 2023 for Epicentre and OCP.
3. CWT data are provided for 2021 and 2022 for OCBA. 

Please be aware that **these data are not exhaustive and do not represent the entire scope of MSF travel emissions**. The data correspond to around 50%-60% of the travels booked per OC. Furthermore, only a small number of Partner Sections are included in the analysis (4 Partner Sections out of 28), and MSF Supply is not included. Also, some information (reason for travel, project code, missions, etc...) are not available for all entities and dates because they are not provided by the travel agencies directly. 

## Emissions factors

The emission factors used in the analysis are following the common MSF methodology designed by **Climate Smart MSF**. Compared with the emission factors DEFRA, MSF have chosen to use those of ADEME, according to our flight typology. While DEFRA insist on the difference of class (economy/business..), ADEME focus on the haul duration (short/middle/long). More informations on the methodology behind carbon emissions can be found on the [Climate Smart MSF website](https://msfintl.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/ClimateSmartMSF/SitePages/Main-Page.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=8t2nc5).
